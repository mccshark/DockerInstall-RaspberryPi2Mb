# DockerInstall-RaspberryPi2Mb
Troubleshooting assistance for anyone trying to setup Docker on Raspberry Pi 2 Model B using Docker instructions provided at:
https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/debian/

All notes and error messages are based on Noobs Debian installation.  Errors are related to apt-gets associated with Debian Jessie (8.0).

Included are the following:

1. A shell script for clean install of Docker using instructions for link above.
2. Non-working Shell script for Raspberry Pi 2 Model B - and abbreviated error messages.
2. Output from terminal session - Bash commands are bolded and errors messages highlighted in yellow.
3. A short list of some of the setup links for Debian, Docker, and troubleshooting (RTF format)
3. A short list of some of the setup links for Debian, Docker, and troubleshooting (TXT format)

Before you get started, the short answer is that the Docker instructions (above) will not work on the Pi2 Model B.

Hope this helps.
